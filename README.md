4:-Deep-learning with python & Big Data

Some projects that were done throughout the course of studying computer science, includes small tasks.
Do note not all projects are included(for example java/matlab/ML) samples weren't uploaded and that some of the projects are not representatives of the materials learnt throughout some courses.

# Adv Linux:
1:- Implementing our own version of the command WC.

2:- Missing.

3:- Implementing our own shell (Bash-like) to serve us through the terminal.

4:- Implementing peer-to-peer file sharing system,a stand-alone server serving unlimited number of clients that want to share(upload) or download shared files.

# Assembly:
1:- Implemention of a "To uppercase" program from user's terminal input.

2:- Implemention of a program that extracts and displays the numbers from any input from the user.

3:- Implemention of a program that takes input of two positive numbers and divides the smaller from the bigger number and displays the result, including the remainder.
4:- Implemention of a program that checks input of email address names for their validity (check that '@' shows up once)
5-7:- Missing.

# Basic frontend:
1:- A very basic use of html css and javascript

# Big-data:
0:- An investigation of a possible correlation between student performance in portuguese language class and the student's socioeconomic status, using the programming language R.

# Adv OOP C++:
ex1:- 

ex2:-
 
ex3:-

# C++:
ex2:- An implemention of the board game "Reversi" with a focus on object oriented programming.

ex4:- A "hockey match" simulation using polymorphism(different roles for players - Forwards, Defensemen and golie), generic implementation of BST and using                 statistical function using the different types of players and their current stats.

ex5:- Simulation of multi-dimensional, includes generic implemention of generic coding of a sorting algorithms and numeric simulation that uses said algorithms

# C:
0:- An implemention of the game "Minesweeper" through the terminal.

# Crypto with Python:
1:- Decrypting given files that were encrypt using PRG-Blum blum shub.

2:- Calculation of phi value of large numbers using euler function and more.

3:- Implementation and use of Elliptic Curve based digital signature.

# Deep-learning with python:
0:- A project pdf containing youtube video/presentation and analysis of results of a model that was trained to detect fire in images.
    heavily relying on Tensorflow tools and Google Colab to train and use the model to predict and report fire detections.

# Fullstack--AdvCSProject(Korkorwz):
0:- A project website- basic idea is to allow users to sign-up to our website to order different types of services (technicians, plumber, mechanic and more), a   database(mySQL) was used to save tickets, types of users and their site premissions and more,The basics of it is that, bosses allocate worker users(with specific job titles) to the submitted customer tickets, workers who can look through the submitted tickets and choose to accept/deny and customers who submit tickets orders and can look at replies and updates on their tickets. Some parts are excluded for security reasons.
code mainly in html, css, javascript.

# Intro to Systems Programming (In C): 
ex3:- Implementation of a zoo management program, implementation of different BSTs to store objects(structs) and the management of them. food supply, employees and animals all separated and managed separately, each group has stats of their own that have status/stat check functions that are BST optimized.

ex4:- basic functions to find VERTEX-COVER using Adjacency-matrix and linked-list.

ex5:- Missing

# Computer Architecture:
0:- MIPS simulator in C, implemented using some instructions from MIPS R4000 Microprocessor User's Manual.

# React-native app project(EasyGet):
0:- Main project done in collaboration. A phone application for ordering food from businesses, said businesses receive order and can choose to accept or deny it, the client is updated throughout the ordering and is informed when the order is ready, mostly done in React, mySQL and firebase.

# Android app project(EncChat):
0:- Found in another repository(Called EncChat in the repositories), is an encrypted chatting platform much like whatsapp for example, with the difference that it only requires a sign-up with an email, users can be found by browsing users list, or searching by usernames, chatting requires accepting friend requests, includes picture sharing.

"EncChat is an encrypted messaging app using RSA cryptosystem and compression of uploaded pictures."
using Firebase for authentication, storing pictures, encrypted messages and push notification functions.

# Unfinished project - Battleship_TERMINAL:
A small project implementing an online board game of battleship.

The two clients will connect to a server program that will be running on a raspberry pi, <in process of giving option to choose board size> after connecting to the server each player sets up their ships and start playing a classic battleship match, the server works as a messenger for each player, sending the coordinates of the attacking player's attack coordinates and to the attacked player, whether its a miss or a hit the attacked player will report back to the server, which in return, will report to the attacking player. the server works so every two players will make a thread that will manage their session.
 
 the game is implemented in a linux environment using c/c++, basic socket and thread mechanisms and can be ran by running three seperate terminals (two clients and one server).
